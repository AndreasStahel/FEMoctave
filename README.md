4. DOCUMENTATION, DEMOS AND EXAMPLES

## 1. HISTORY
The first version of FEMoctave was written in 2000.
In 2020 a new version was generated.
In 2022 a major update is available.
In 2023 elasticity problems can be solved, plane stress, plane strain and axially symmetric setups
In 2023 algorithms for 1D problems are available

## 2. PURPOSE
The main goal is to provide a tool using Octave only to teach the method of finite elements, short FEM.
The mathematics of the algorithms are spelled out and implemented in Octave

## 3. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
To use all features of FEMoctave you have to install triangle.
Find the source code and instructions at
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

## 4. DOCUMENTATION, DEMOS AND EXAMPLES
The subdirectories doc contain many sample codes, documented in doc/FEMdoc.pdf .

In section 3 of FEMdoc.pdf short demos are shown, one of each type.
The subdirectory doc/Demos contains the codes.

In section 9 of FEMdoc.pdf many examples are given.
The subdirectory doc/Examples contains the codes.
